Web Development was the first topic that brought me into programming. 
I started with simple HTML and CSS websites. I got an opportunity to take part in an internship. 
I learned there about the Python programming language. I was amazed by the simplicity of the syntax in comparison to C++ that I was being taught in my school. 
After Python, I learned about Django and DRF. I created more Advanced applications with the PostgreSQL database and Django ORM. 
During my next internship, I learned about the Frontend. 
I had already some basic JavaScript knowledge and on top of that, I was introduced to React. I used APIs to get data, created layouts and animations. 
Other than that I spend a lot of time studying different documentations and making personal apps to advance my knowledge.
